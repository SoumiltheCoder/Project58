        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My name is Soumil Das.I study in standard 6th A.My favourite hobby is cricket and Lawn Tennis

My hobby is playing cricket. Cricket is my favorite sport. When I get some free time after my studies,I go outside to the ground with my friends and play cricket. Cricket is the game which requires physical fitness. The running between the wickets, fielding within the ground and stress bearing during batting and fielding make my body fit and mind fresh. So, after playing cricket when I study, I can better grab the concepts. I also become delighted by playing cricket because I donâ€™t waste my mind sitting in front of a computer or playing video games. Instead, I do some healthy activity. On every Sunday evening, I have two or three hours free. Mostly, I play cricket at that time. I have purchased my cricket kit. I watch it in television . My another hobby is Lawn Tennis I have being learning it in Vazirani National Sports Academy I have been learning it for more than three and a half years I now all the shots. You should be very active and fast you half to run half the court to hit a shot the tennis ball can come anywhere in the court. We have to be good at a service,Back hand and a four hand I now have 2 lawn tennis racket and many balls at home. It is very interesting game. --Soumil Das </p>
